# SCARV AND

This folder contains the extracted AND modules used by the SCARV core, the config file (`config.set`) and a script (`run.sh`) containing the required commands to invoke PROLEAD.

We have used `Icarus Verilog` within all modules to verify the correctness of the Verilog code.
If you are not interested in this, but want to use the Makefile, just remove the corresponding targets.
